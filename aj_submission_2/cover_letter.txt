Cover letter explaining the changes made in response to the referee's comments
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We thank the referee for their careful reading of the manuscript and their valuable comments which the author feels improves the overall quality of the paper. We attach a scanned version of Drake (1985) which, as the referee correctly pointed out, is not available on ADS.

In the following sections we address the referee's comments.

########################################################
Referee: In Section 4, the authors confront their observations to available 1-D semi-empirical chromospheric and wind models. Although the authors detail the output of the adopted wind models (e.g., predicted velocity and temperature laws in Fig 3), a (brief) physical description of these models should also be incorporated in the manuscript. This is particularly relevant concerning the models of Drake (1985), which were published in the proceedings of a workshop and is not available to download through ADS.

Response: In the 1st paragraph of Section 4.2 we have now added some additional information about the Drake model:
"......The line was modeled by solving the radiative transfer equation in a spherical co-moving frame and the effects of partial redistribution (e.g., Drake & Linsky 1983b) were taken into account. Both of Drake's atmospheric models contain the photospheric model of Ayres & Linskey (1975), predict the wind to reach a terminal velocity of 35 - 40 km s${}^{-1}$ by 2 $R _{\star}$, and reach a maximum microturbulence of 5 km s$^{-1}$......"

In the 3rd paragraph of Section 4.2 we have now added some additional information about the McMurry and Robinson et al.'s models. This paragraph now reads:
"In Figure 2 we plot the expected radio spectrum of $\alpha$ Tau based on the semi-empirical 1-D chromosphere and transition region model of McMurry (1999) embedded in the 1-D wind model of Robinson (1998). The semi-empirical  McMurry model was created by using the radiative transfer code MULTI (Carlsson, 1986) to reproduce the fluxes of collisionally excited C I, C II, Si III, Mg II, and C IV lines in a plane-parallel, hydrostatic, one-component atmosphere. It contains the photospheric model of Johnson (1973) and reaches a maximum temperature of 10$^{5}$ K at 1.2 $R_{\star}$. As it does not contain a wind outflow, we use Robinson's wind characteristics beyond 1.2 $R_{\star}$ to describe the outflow velocity. In this wind model, the wind reaches $\sim$80\% of its terminal value of 30 km s$^{-1}$ by 3 $R_{\star}$. The Robinson wind characteristics are based on matching the Fe II 2755 $\rm{\AA}$ line and the O I triplet near 1304 $\rm{\AA}$ with a simplified wind model using the SEI computer code. We assume the wind to have a constant temperature of 10,000 K and have a constant ionization fraction, $x_{e}$, of 0.5 throughout, based on the ionization fraction at the corresponding temperature in the McMurry model."

Referee: The adopted models of Drake (1985) and Robinson et al (1998) seem to have been developed to semi-empirically fit data that were acquired at different facilities. The non-smooth shape of velocity and temperature profiles in Figure 3 indicate that a physically self-consistent driving mechanism is not accounted for in these models. The Alfven-wave driven wind models of Krogulec (1988, 1989) are more sophisticated in this respect, but their predictions do not agree with the presented observations. Figure 2 shows that the Alfven-wave driven models over-estimate the observed radio fluxes. While this is indeed the case, the authors need to clarify in the discussion on page 7 (2nd column, penultimate paragraph) that the lack of agreement is not necessarily due to a wrong physical perception of the wind driving mechanism, but, as stated by Krogulec (1988), by the large uncertainties in the free parameters of the model, which lead to degenerate wind solutions. Therefore, it is likely that the models such as the one provided by Krogulec (1988, 1989) could provide reasonable fits to the data if the set of free parameters were observationally constrained by data such as the one presented in the manuscript.

Response: We have now added the following sentence to the end of this paragraph:
"The linear Alfv´en wave models for Alpha Boo (Krogulec 1988) also assume full ionization and have higher mass loss rates than the established value given in
Table 1, predicting higher flux densities than observed. The lack of agreement between the Alfv´en wave-driven wind models of Krogulec (1988, 1989) and our observed radio fluxes may not necessarily be due to an incorrect wind driving mechanism and instead may be due to the simplifications and uncertainties in these models, such as wind densities, magnetic field strengths, and damping lengths. For example, the mass loss rate is very sensitive to the radial surface magnetic field strength (i.e., \dot{M} \propto B4) in these Alfv´en wave models (Holzer et al. 1983) so a small uncertainty in the mass loss rate can lead to a large uncertainty in the magnetic field strength. Relaxing some of these simplifications such as purely radial flows or non-assumption of the WKB approximation (Charbonneau & MacGregor 1995) may also also lead to better agreement with our radio data."

Referee:  Table 1: wind terminal velocities, mass loss rates and temperatures are not 'Properties of the red giant sample', as stated in the caption, but are parameters derived from semi-empirical models. This should be stated in the caption. In addition, no error bars are provided for the derived wind parameters. How constrained are those values?

Response: Changed table caption to "Stellar and Wind Parameters of Alpha Boo and Alpha Tau." In tablenotes we have added "Wind parameters are derived from the semi-empirical models of Drake (1985) and Robinson et al. (1998). The Ca II ionization studies of Harper (2004) indicate a wind temperature of $T_{e}\lesssim 1\times 10^4$ K for Alpha Tau." 
It is difficult to estimate the exact uncertainties in the parameters derived in these semi-empirical models. Often the choice of which model best fits the data is an individuals judgement and often one gets a range of possible parameter values.

Referee: Discussion of chromospheric variability: Based on the different fluxes observed by their 6cm-data and previous observations, the authors claim that alpha Tau presents chromospheric variability. The variation between different observations is more than a factor of two. A similar level of variability (a factor 6.09/3.3~1.8) is seen between their 0.7cm-data and previous observations of alpha Boo. However, contrary to alpha Tau, the authors argue that the variability seen in alpha Boo observations cannot be attributed to chromospheric variability, because it "would be unexpected from such supposedly inactive stars (Harper et al. 2013)." Why is the difference in flux at 6 cm for alpha Tau attributed to variability, while the difference at 0.7 cm for alpha Boo is believed to be unreal? Note that chromospheric variability has been found in both targets, as is reported in the last paragraph of page 2.

Response: We do not make any claims of either chromospheric or wind variability in this paper and stress that the disagreement at Q-band (for Alpha Boo) and at C-band (for Alpha Tau) can only be solved with future observations at these wavelengths. We have re-worded one sentence to make this more clear. 
"Such a level of chromospheric variability seems rather high and would be unexpected from such supposedly inactive stars \citep{2013MNRAS.428.2064H}." --> "Although we do not rule out such a level of chromospheric radio variability, it is not expected based on the small level of UV variability observed from such supposedly inactive stars \citep{2013MNRAS.428.2064H}."

########################################################
Referee: "VLA bands (i.e., X and Ku)" -> "VLA bands (i.e., C and Ku)"

Response: This should stay the same. Alpha Tau was not detected at C band prior to our observations (only upper limits were placed on it). It was detected at X and Ku bands as given in Wood et al. (2007).

Referee:  Figures 1 and 2 summaries the most important results of this paper and I believe it is important to present these figures in the clearest possible manner. For example, to directly associate this figure to Tables 3 and 4, I suggest the authors to present the figures in log scales in both x and y axes, with the x-axis in units of GHz. The current plot is presented in linear xy-scales, where x=log10(nu) and y=log10(flux). Therefore, the comparison between {x,y} and {nu,flux} is currently not direct and requires conversions. In addition, the discussion in the text (esp. Section 4) usually refers to wavelength and not to frequency. Therefore, the manuscript would read more smoothly if either the discussion referred to frequency or if Figures 1 and 2 presented an extra axis for wavelength at the top.

Response: We have now added an additional wavelength axis to the top of both Figure 1 and 2. We have decided to leave the axes in linear xy-scales, where x=log10(nu) and y=log10(flux) but the x-axes are now in GHz for to match the text. We have also added a wavelength column to both Table 3 and 4 to help the reader.

Referee:  "We find the source to have a spectral index alpha (F_nu \propto nu^alpha) of -1.4" -> the spectral index should be positive.

Response: Here we are talking about the strongest source in our maps of Alpha Boo. It is a non-thermal source and therefore has a negative spectral index. We have clarified this in the text from:
"This source was reported by Drake & Linskey (1986) and their flux density of 25 mJy at 4.9 GHz is in close agreement with our measurement of 23.2 mJy at the same frequency. We find the source to have a spectral index $\alpha$ ($F_{\nu} \propto \nu ^{\alpha}$) of -1.4; its flux density reaches 80.3 mJy at 1.6 GHz."

"This non-thermal source was reported by Drake & Linskey (1986) and their flux density of 25 mJy at 4.9 GHz is in close agreement with our measurement of 23.2 mJy at the same frequency. We find the source to have a spectral index $\alpha$ ($F_{\nu} \propto \nu ^{\alpha}$) of -1.4 between 8.5 and 1.6 GHz; its flux density reaches 80.3 mJy at 1.6 GHz."

########################################################
Referee:  What is the spectral index of alpha Tau and how does it compare to the value of 1.4 found for alpha Boo? (Only the spectral index for the longest wavelengths is provided in 4.3.)

Response: We do not give the total spectral index (derived from all the VLA frequencies) for either of the stars, as such a value would be probing 3 orders of magnitude in continuum optical depth (mentioned in Section 1.1) and whose integrated emission is from a range of stellar radii.

Referee:  "Our computed radio spectrum reproduces Drake's (1985) predicted flux density value of 0.4 mJy at 6 cm." -> There are other points that reproduce previous observations as well: at 43GHz, 22GHz. Is there any particular reason why only the 6-cm agreement is mentioned?

Response: In Drake's paper he predicts that his model would produce a radio flux of 0.4 mJy at 6 cm. He doesn't give estimates at other wavelengths. We have re-worded this sentence for clarity to now be: "Drake (1985) predicts that their atmospheric model would produce a flux density value of 0.4 mJy at 6 cm and encouragingly, our radio spectrum reproduces this value."

########################################################
Referee:  "Figure 1 shows the resulting predicted radio spectrum between 1 GHz and 1 THz for alpha Boo from these chromo- sphere and wind models." -> add "(green line)" at the end of sentence.

Response: Added this to text.

Referee:   "The combinations of the electron temperature and density coefficients are shown for each star in Figure 5 along with the coefficients obtained by assuming either an isothermal flow or a constant velocity flow." -> "The combinations of the electron temperature and density coefficients are shown for each star in Figure 5 (alpha Boo is represented by the solid line and alpha Tau by the dash-dotted line) along with the coefficients obtained by assuming either an isothermal flow (n=0) or a constant velocity flow (p=2)."

Response: Changed the text to this.


We now address the referee's final 3 comments in one response below (made up 2 paragraphs):
########################################################
Referee:   "These waves would need to have large damping lengths and undergo some dissipation within a few stellar radii of the surface in order to produce the low terminal velocities" -> The waves need to have *small* (typically < 1 Rstar) damping lengths and undergo *substantial* dissipation, otherwise the terminal velocities predicted by the models are too large (cf also Jatenco-Pereira & Opher 1989A&A...209..327J; Vidotto et al 2006ApJ...639..416V).

Referee:  "This assumption is reasonable at short wavelengths where the majority of the radio emission is expected to emanate from the chromosphere or wind acceleration zone, but at long VLA wavelengths (i.e., between 6 and 20 cm) we may indeed be sampling the wind very close to or at its terminal velocity and the wind may have substantial thermal gradients caused by adiabatic cooling." -> Can the authors quantify what is considered as 'substantial thermal gradients'? Because the damping length required to produce low-terminal-velocity winds is small, the heating deposition due to dissipation of Alfven waves occurs very close to the 'base' of the wind as is shown for instance in plots from Krogulec 1988, 1989 (cf also Jatenco-Pereira & Opher 1989; Falceta-Goncalves et al 2006; Vidotto et al 2006). These models suggest that very close to the wind base, the temperature increases by a factor of a few above the photospheric value.

Referee:   "If we ignore thermal gradients, then the density coefficients are p =2.71 and 5.5 for alpha Boo and alpha Tau, respectively." -> From mass conservation arguments (and assuming a constant ionization fraction), one can relate the power-law index of the radial density profile to a power-law index of the velocity (v) profile, such that v \propto r^(p-2). Using the values of p derived, for alpha Boo one finds v \propto r^0.71 and for alpha Tau v \propto r^3.5. This indeed confirms (mathematically) that the large wavelengths probe the steep-acceleration region of alpha Tau (base of the wind zone), a conclusion reached by the authors on page 9 by different arguments ("but even our longest-wavelength observations are highly unlikely to sample the wind outside the lower velocity layers closer to the star."). Similarly for alpha Boo, the long-wavelength region probe a region where the wind has reached a steady terminal velocity," agreeing with the mathematical argument presented above (i.e., the velocity profile has a smoother increase of v \propto r^0.71).

Response: 
We have broken this paragraph up into two separate ones and re-worded a significant portion of the text.
"Equation 1 can be used in conjunction with our new spectral index for each star to calculate the density and temperature coefficients that may describe their outflows. The combinations of the electron temperature and density coefficients are shown for each star in Figure 5 (Alpha Boo is represented by the solid line and Alpha Tau by the dash-dotted line) along with the coefficients obtained by assuming either an isothermal flow (n = 0) or a constant velocity flow (p = 2). One potential explanation for spectral indices of stellar outflows being larger than 0.6 is that the wind is still accelerating in the radio emitting region, if the thermal gradients are assumed to be small. If we ignore thermal gradients completely, then the density coefficients are $p  =2.7$ and 5.5 for $\alpha$ Boo and $\alpha$ Tau, respectively. From mass conservation arguments assuming a steady flow, the power law coefficients for the velocity profiles of each star can be found, ie., $v(r) \propto r^{p-2}$. For $\alpha$ Boo we find $v(r) \propto r^{0.7}$ while for $\alpha$ Tau we find $v(r) \propto r^{3.5}$. This suggests that our long VLA wavelengths may probe a steep acceleration region for $\alpha$ Tau's outflow but for $\alpha$ Boo, may probe a region where its wind is close to its terminal velocity. 

The assumption of completely ignoring thermal gradients in a stellar outflow is probably unreliable however. It is likely that some form of Alfv\`{e}n waves are required to lift the material out of the gravitational potential as suggested by Hartmann & MacGregor (1980). These waves need damping lengths which are much larger than the density scale height $H$ (where $H \sim 0.005 R_{\star}$ for our targets), in order to lift the material out of the gravitational potential but $\lesssim 1 \, R_{\star}$ in order to avoid wind terminal velocities greater than those observed (e.g. Holzer et al. 1983). It has also been shown that these waves are expected to produce substantial heating deposition near the base of the wind (Hartmann et al. 1982). If the long wavelength radio emission from $\alpha$ Tau is indeed emanating from the wind acceleration region, then the dissipation of these Alfv\`{e}n waves may introduce thermal gradients in this region and its velocity profile will not be described by $v(r) \propto r^{3.5}$. Furthermore, diverging flow geometries have been invoked as a more realistic representation of stellar atmospheres (Hartmann & MacGregor 1982; Jatenco-Pereira & Opher 1989; Vidotto et al. 2006) and so one could write the continuity equation for a steady flow as 
\begin{equation}
\dot{M} _{\star} = f(r)4\pi r^2 \rho (r) v(r),
\end{equation}
where $f(r)$ is a function describing the divergence from a purely radial flow [i.e., $f(r)=1$], $\dot{M} _{\star}$ is the stellar mass loss rate, and $\rho(r)$ is the gas density at $r$. If the non-radial expansion term can be described by a power-law $f(r) \propto r^s$, where $s>1$ indicates super-radial expansion, then $v(r) \propto r^{3.5-s}$ would describe the velocity profile of $\alpha$ Tau (ignoring thermal gradients and assuming a constant ionization fraction). Further out in the wind, where it has reached its terminal velocity, one would also expect a thermal gradient (but now of opposite sign) due to adiabatic expansion and line cooling. If the long wavelength radio emission emanates from this region of the wind then Equation \ref{eq:eq1} provides us with a direct estimate of the temperature coefficient as we can assume the density coefficient is $p=2$. This may be the case for our long VLA wavelength measurements of $\alpha$ Boo in which case $T_{e}(r) \propto r^{-1.65}$.
